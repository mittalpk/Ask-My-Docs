Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 

Key concepts in machine learning include:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Training with labeled data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Association Rules
   - Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through interaction with environment
   - Reward-based learning system
   - Applications: Game playing, Robotics

Machine learning applications include:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

The machine learning pipeline typically involves:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Selection
4. Training
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

Popular machine learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and Keras.
